                Remember that feeling when you hop on a bike after years of not riding? 
                That's how it felt diving into my first coding assignment today as I embarked on my journey to become a full stack developer and SEO expert. 
                The initial wobbles soon gave way to a thrilling ride down memory lane, as the once-forgotten coding skills began to resurface and take shape.

            Once upon a time, in the land of audiovisual wizardry, I was a savvy Assistant Director and Producer. 
            But then, like a brave adventurer, I ventured into the mystical realm of IT, trading my clapperboard for a keyboard. 
            As a natural chaos-tamer, I'm stoked to combine my love for tech, trends, and all things artsy in my shiny new career as a full stack developer and SEO guru.

            Fun fact: I'm a language buff who can chat your ears off in English, Portuguese, and Spanish, and even throw in a bit of Italian for good measure. 
            I'm like a detail-detective with a sharp eye for aesthetics, always on the lookout for the big picture. 
            In the IT jungle, my proactive, self-reliant, and ridiculously organized nature helps me survive and thrive!

            I've got a major in Social Audiovisual Communication and a Master of Visual Media Design under my belt. 
            My résumé is sprinkled with a medley of creative projects—ads, films, shorts, political campaigns, music videos, and more. 
            Now, I'm leveling up my skills by diving headfirst into the world of full stack development and SEO mastery. 
            IT's like a giant buffet, and I'm ready to find my favorite dish!

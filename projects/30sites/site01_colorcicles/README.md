### Again, why am I doing this?
<p> I am learning how to code and I felt the need for some practice and is how they say: the best way to learn is practicing. <br>
So I challenged myself to learn Javascript ES6+, React and Node within my first 30 websites. </p>

### Why I chose to do this one?
<p>I'm studiying Javascript through [Rockeseat](https://app.rocketseat.com.br/dashboard) free courses and this is one of the challenges of the Javascript module. <br>
I just made couple of minor modifications.</p>

### What I learned?
<p> 1. Finally I got how the DOM works and how to manipulate it. <br>
I've watch so many courses and tutorials all over the internet, and none of them was clear enough for me. So, thank you Rocketseat! <br>
2. I read this awesome tutorial by [Mabishi Wakio](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/understanding-hoisting-in-javascript) about hoisting in Javascript.<br>
I learned the difference between Output: undefined and Output: ReferenceError. <br>
- undefined appears whe the variable is not declared. <br>
- ReferenceError when the variable is declared but out of the scope. <br>
This was very helpful at debugging with the console. Very newbie, I know, but I'm learning! <br>
Let's go to the next challenge!</p>

### Again, why am I doing this?
<p> I am learning how to code and I felt the need for some practice and is how they say: the best way to learn is practicing. <br>
So I challenged myself to learn Javascript ES6+, React and Node within my first 30 websites. </p>

### Why I chose to do this one?
<p> I found those funny faces pictures on the internet and the idea just clicked. <br>
So I looked up for a tutorial for a memory game and I ended up finding a lot of female developers <br>
which has been a personal quest since a couple of weeks ago. <br>
This is a link for the tutorial: [Memory Card Game by Marina Ferreira](https://marina-ferreira.github.io/tutorials/js/memory-game.pt-br/)</p>

### What I learned?
<p> A LOT OF STUFF!
I it wasn't because I understood the logic behind everystep of the code, I would say my impostor syndrome kicked high <br>
through this challenge and I felt as total begginer. <br>
I learned about: <br
1. IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) wich are functions that are executed as they're declared. <br>
They follow the normal syntaxis, like if the function inside the () is a substitute for the function's name: <br>
> (function name() { code }) (); <br>
2. When display:flex is declared, the flex-items order can be acessed and manipulated to visually be where we want them to be. <br>
This doesn't change the order of the document and could bring some accessibility issues <br>
I used it to pair the cards through the "datakey" attribute (data-key = "name"). <br>
3. I was also able to understand what's behind a game's logic and when and why declaring and calling variables and functions. <br>
It was very stimulating for me.

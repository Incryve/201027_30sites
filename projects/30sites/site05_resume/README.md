### Again, why am I doing this?
<p> I am learning how to code and I felt the need for some practice and is how they say: the best way to learn is practicing. <br>
So I challenged myself to learn Javascript ES6+, React and Node within my first 30 websites. </p>

### Why I chose to do this one?
<p> I needed to update my resume because I'm a developer now. <br>
So I thought it would be fun to have a PDF available on my website and ready to download.
In the middle of the way, I felt the need to have it as an icon so ended up with links to all <br>
my social networks.  
</p>

### What I learned?
<p> 
1. How awesome is Font Awesome! <br>
They offer cool icons so you can copy paste them to your website. Is very easy to use: just import<br>
the script to your html and paste the code where you want the icon to be. <br>
2. I also learn how to make those icons clickable and to direct a link to download a PDF file! <br>
Just add "download" as an atribute to the anchor html tag. <br>
Also, to make an anchor "send" an email, we use the "mailto:" atribute. <br>
Maybe not so much knowledge for today, but at least I can try that job offer I want so much!

### Again, why am I doing this?
<p> I am learning how to code and I felt the need for some practice and is how they say: the best way to learn is practicing. <br>
So I challenged myself to do so on a daily basis by coding a website per day during the next 3 months. </p>

### Why I chose to do this one?
<p>I needed a app to help me and my significant other to make housing choices, like do the dishes. When I saw Jennifer's project <br>
I understood the logic behind it and challenged myself to make it a little more complicated. So there it is: <br>
a vanilla javascript rock, paper, scissors, lizard, spock.</p>

### What I learned?
<p> 1. Template literals: It help me when I needed to pass a variable as a string at the displayresults(). <br>
It presents with a different syntax than the normal strings as it uses a `` instead of the normal ''. <br>
2. Foreach and arrow function: as I wanted to select all the buttons, I used querySelectorAll wich returns an array. <br>
So to iterate through it, I used the foreach method. That way I could access each button and their ids. 
3. I also learned about arrow functions and tried it for the first time. I'll try to practice them a little more. </p>

### Again, why am I doing this?
<p> I am learning how to code and I felt the need for some practice and is how they say: the best way to learn is practicing. <br>
So I challenged myself to do so on a daily basis by coding a website per day during the next 3 months. </p>

### Why I chose to do this one?
<p>I always useful to have a clock at hand and seemed easy enough for a weekend job. <br>
Also because this would allow me to practice with default Javascript objetcs and methods.</p>

### What I learned?
<p> 1. Conditional Ternary is a Javascript operator that takes 3 operands: a condition (wich gives the 'conditional' name), followed by a "?", <br>
then the truthy condition followed by a ":" and finally the falsy condition. I used it to add "0" before single numbers.<br>
2. Date method makes every date/time operation really easy as Javascript takes the browser information and returns it as a string.
If you run my code, you'll see this information in the console.<br>

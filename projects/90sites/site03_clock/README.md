### Again, why am I doing this?
<p> I am learning how to code and I felt the need for some practice and is how they say: the best way to learn is practicing. <br>
So I challenged myself to learn Javascript ES6+, React and Node within my first 30 websites. </p>

### Why I chose to do this one?
<p>I always useful to have a clock at hand and seemed easy enough for a weekend job. <br>
Also because this would allow me to practice with default Javascript objetcs and methods.</p>

### What I learned?
<p> 1. Conditional Ternary is a Javascript operator that takes 3 operands: a condition (wich gives the 'conditional' name), followed by a "?", <br>
then the truthy condition followed by a ":" and finally the falsy condition. I used it to add "0" before single numbers.<br>
2. Javascript default Date Object makes every date/time operation really easy as Javascript takes that information from the browser and returns it as a string <br> If you run my code, you'll see this information in the console. <br>
3. Once I had that information I just needed to add it to the HTML and refresh it every second. <br>
Wich was possible with the Javascript Time Event called setTimeOut that allows the code to execute with time intervals. <br>
Great, right? 
4. I used my knowledge from the last challenge to complicate this one a little more as I finished it to quick, <br>
so I added a night mode toggling CSS classes in Javascript. Code is fun! </p>
